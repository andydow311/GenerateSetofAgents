# GenerateSetofAgents

I am learning Golang and rereating a number of game theory problems to help me. This simple project simply uses the bufio and os lubraries to read an imput txt file and translate the text into Agent structs.

To run:

  **go run main.go agents.go agents.txt**

To run tests:

**go mod init agents_test.go  
go mod tidy
go test**
